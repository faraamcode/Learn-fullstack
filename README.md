# Learn-fullstack

- Welcome Onboard guys,

- This program aims to help ourselves make a good use of our free time during this pandemic period. We pray to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) to end it soonest and ease all our Affairs.

During the course of this program We're working on a server monitoring software.

\*The app will:\*\*

- Let users sign up and login.
- When the user logs in, he is navigated to his dashboard.
- User can add one or more websites to monitor.
- The app will check the website(s) every minute and will let the user know when it's down.
- The user will be alerted via email, call, SMS.
- User can also attach his twitter account and the updates about the website(s) will be posted there.
- Dashboard will show the uptime percent from the day the `websites to monitor` were added and will also show the current status of the website(s) - If its `Online` or `Offline`

## Technologies Covered

- Git

### Why server monitoring?

It covers most concepts to build an app - from relationships in the database, to workers, to third party API integration and more. You can finish the app fairly quickly and get a good understanding of all the concepts from `Web Development`
